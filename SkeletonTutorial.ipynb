    "## Topology-aware neuroanatomical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons are, in general, tree-like structures. While there are fine scale anatomical details like spines and boutons, their anatomy can be largely described as a collection of branched linear processes and a roughly spherical cell body (or soma). This representation of a neuron is called a \"skeleton\". Because of this, many of the topological aspects of trees in general are useful for neurons as well, for example defining \"branch points\" and \"end points\" or \"tips\". Moreover, the notion of a \"root\" — in our case the soma — lets us define a base point from which we can define notions of \"downstream\" and \"upstream\". Finally, because a tree has no loops, there is only one possible path between any two points on a skeleton and thus many computations are much faster than on a much larger mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we explore the meshparty implementation of such topologically aware data structures. First, we will look at basic Skeletons, which handle the operations like those mentioned above. Second, we will look at \"Meshworks\", objects that combine meshes, skeletons, and annotations to try to simply how these three useful types of data work together."
